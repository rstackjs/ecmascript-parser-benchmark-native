# Repository Guidelines

- Do not update `README.md` unless necessary, except to update benchmark charts, data, and related objective benchmark information.
- Keep `README.md` limited to objective benchmark data and instructions for running and reproducing the benchmarks.
- Do not include subjective judgments, rankings expressed as opinions, or speculative explanations of performance differences, such as "why xxx is slower".

- Run `pnpm preflight` before recording timings. Generated JSON snapshots under `ast/` are local verification artifacts and must not be committed. AST schema differences alone do not prove a parser bug.
